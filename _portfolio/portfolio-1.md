title: "Your HLT Internship (with a much more explanatory title)"
excerpt: "Short description of the goals and content of your internship<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
collection: portfolio

This is an item in your portfolio that describes your internship. It can have images or nice text. If you name the file .md, it will be parsed as markdown. If you name the file .html, it will be parsed as HTML.

As you're describing the content of your internship, be sure to describe how you were able to apply the concepts and skills you acquired from HLT courses to your internship. You'll also want to describe the things that you learned from the internship itself that might help you in future work.

## Evaluation criteria
Remember that each of the two projects in your portfolio will be evaluated on these points:

* **Length**: A summary of the project goals, technology used, and outcomes, as appropriate for a general technical audience, between 1000 and 3000 words (not counting code)
* **Content**: studentâ€™s experience demonstrates the learning outcomes for the MSHLT program [^note]
* **Code**: Code is contained in the site, or a link to the code (such as in a GitHub repository) exists on the site.
* **Professionalism**: Free of grammatical, mechanical, and stylistic issues
* **Above and beyond**: How well does this component communicate the most relevant features?

[^note]: The learning outcomes of the MSHLT program are:
    
    1. Students will demonstrate programming skills for the workplace.
    2. Students will be able to use fundamental algorithms and concepts in Natural Language Processing.
    3. Students will show knowledge of tools and packages used in Natural Language Processing.
